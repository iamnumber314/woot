downloadify
===========

Wow... did not think i would get this much coverage. And to be honest I am glad it was fixed with warp speed by the good guys at Spotify!

So why did I put this on Github en kept it up? I did not think anybody still wanted to download music, I mean streaming / the cloud is the shit. And I found it strange nobody in about six months wrote anything about the lack of security on part of Spotify.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TL;DR; THIS DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
